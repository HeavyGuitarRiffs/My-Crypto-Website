        Hi <br><br>
        
        These are questions most frequently asked in interviews and on applications, so I figured I would compile them!
        <br><br>
    
        Please briefly describe your proficiency in Solidity and experience developing smart contracts on Ethereum or other EVM-compatible blockchains (e.g., Polygon, Binance Smart Chain).I completed a course in Solidity in the Summer of 2024, and compiled a boilerplate for it, saving it to my GitHub.
    <br><br>
    I have been practicing minting NFT's on Polygon Network via my Metamask wallet, and uploading them to OpenSea.
    
    I also have some experience testing, and improving smart contracts written in the Remix compiler. It is a very interesting way the compiler calls the code to connect with various Web3 Wallets.
    <br><br>
    Please briefly describe your familiarity with integrating AI/ML models or APIs (e.g., OpenAI, TensorFlow, Hugging Face) into applications.I recently built a few applications to test the augmentation of resumes and cover letters as plugins for Google and other sites where those documents are generated. 
    <br><br>
    I configured a MONGO_URI string to connect to the backend of OpenAI, and generated the OpenAI Secret Key to source in the project's .env file, allowing it to be called in the server.js file.
    <br><br>
    Please briefly describe your experience and knowledge of machine learning concepts, natural language processing (NLP), or computer vision frameworks.I see that Outlier.AI is become a very popular NLP and machine learning platform, very popular with many people.
    
    AI can break what it builds, though more specified questions lead to more specific and improved responses.
    
    Many math, and education software producing companies study NLP, and machine learning networks, and produce them in great detail.
    <br><br>
    Please briefly describe your experience with or understanding of decentralized finance protocols, standards, and platforms.I have been using DEFI dapps, and wallets for close to 10 years now. I very much am impressed by the plug ins and user auth process that connects the wallets to web3 platforms like OpenSea.io for minting, buting selling, and curating collections of NFTs.
    
    I like the Coinbase Wallet, Trust, Ronin, My Ether Wallet, have received a few airdrops, and stake a few coins on wallets like Metamask.
    
    Interesting to note how they also connect to Remix compilers for smart contract validation and testing.
    <br><br>
    Please rate your understanding of blockchain protocols, decentralized architecture, and how AI can enhance dApps on a scale from 0 to 10.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    Do you have experience debugging and optimizing Solidity-based smart contracts and AI-enabled decentralized applications?
    <br><br>
    yes
    <br><br>
    Are you familiar with Hedera native services, such as the Hedera Token Service (HTS) and Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)?
    <br><br>
    Have you been actively involved in blockchain or AI-focused open-source projects and communities?
    <br><br>
    "Do you have experience with building a Decentralized Exchange?"
    <br><br>
    I have experience working on and testing new features on decentralized exchanges, yes
    <br><br>
    How many years of work experience do you have with Smart Contracts?"
    <br><br>
    I have been working with Smart Contracts for just over a year
    <br><br>
    
    Have you ever used any Coinbase products?
    <br><br>
    I have been using Coinbase wallet since 2014. 
    It was the first crypto wallet I tried. In 2020 
    I heard of the new decentralized wallet, and started to use that for securing altcoins, and learning about Ethereum based chains. 
    <br><br>
    
    How many years of work experience do you have with Blockchain Architecture?How many years of work experience do you have with Rust?
    <br><br>
    How many years of work experience do you have with Cosmos SDK?How many years of work experience do you have with Cosmos WASM?How many years of React.js and React Native experience do you have?
    <br><br>
        
        Truly, <br><br>
